# Grade 5 English Tutoring Materials 

_Orton-Gillingham Approach_

Welcome to the **Grade 5 English Tutoring Repository** built on the **Orton-Gillingham (OG)** principles. These materials are ideal for structured, multisensory language instruction focused on phonemic awareness, decoding, grammar, spelling, and writing.

## Teaching Methodology

The **Orton-Gillingham approach** is:
- **Structured** and **sequential**
- **Phonics-based** and **language-centered**
- **Multisensory** (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- Tailored to individual student needs
- Focused on reading, spelling, and writing
