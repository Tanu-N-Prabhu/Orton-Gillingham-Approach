## Tutor Tips (Orton-Gillingham)

- Pre-teach hard words (e.g., *peaceful*, *curved*, *instructions*) by breaking them into syllables.
- Emphasize vowel teams (e.g., *stream*, *believe*) and r-controlled vowels (*curved*, *forest*).
- Encourage the student to underline or color-code tricky parts after writing.
- Have the student read the full paragraph aloud to build fluency.
