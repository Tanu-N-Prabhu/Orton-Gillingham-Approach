## Reading Passage  

**The Mysterious Library**  

On a rainy afternoon, Mia was walking home from school when she noticed an old building she had never seen before. The sign above the door read: *“The Mysterious Library – Open to All Who Seek Adventure.”*  

Curious, she stepped inside. The library was dimly lit, and rows of tall bookshelves stretched farther than her eyes could see. The air smelled of old paper and ink. Mia picked up a book with a golden cover. As soon as she opened it, the words began to glow. Suddenly, the room around her changed—she was standing in the middle of a jungle with parrots flying overhead and the sound of rushing water nearby.  

She realized the library books were magical—they could transport readers into their stories. Excited, Mia explored for hours, traveling through deserts, castles, and even outer space. But when she heard the town clock strike six, she knew it was time to return home. She closed the book and found herself back in the library. The librarian, a kind old man, smiled and whispered, “Remember, every adventure begins with a book.”  

Mia left the library with a promise to return the next day.
